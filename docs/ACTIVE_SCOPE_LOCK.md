# Active Scope Lock

## Route

Current: `TRACEBENCH_NEW_PROJECT_WIZARD_REDESIGN_SCOPE_LOCK_PASS`
Next: `TRACEBENCH_NEW_PROJECT_WIZARD_FOUNDATION_PASS`

## Authority transition

Baseline `b228a0b8dcfaf9b779b8c5ac5d14d7be2b001c5e` contains the exact pushed
result of `TRACEBENCH_EVIDENCE_INTEGRITY_REPAIR_PASS`. Its seven-file authority
is spent and retained only in Git and existing evidence.

The human's 2026-07-27 decision selected the BenchBeep
`Loo projekt nullist` redesign from the non-executable
`NEEDS_USER_DECISION` pointer. It authorizes only this docs-only scope lock.
No prior allowlist or product authority is inherited.

## Exact current write allowlist

`TRACEBENCH_NEW_PROJECT_WIZARD_REDESIGN_SCOPE_LOCK_PASS` may write exactly:

- `docs/ACTIVE_SCOPE_LOCK.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`
- `docs/PASS_QUEUE.md`
- `docs/AUDIT_INDEX.md`
- `docs/audit/TRACEBENCH_NEW_PROJECT_WIZARD_REDESIGN_SCOPE_LOCK_PASS.md`

No sixth file is authorized.

## Reserved implementation pass

```text
PASS_ID: TRACEBENCH_NEW_PROJECT_WIZARD_FOUNDATION_PASS
Lane: A
Mode: FLUTTER_PASS
```

Exact future write allowlist:

- `lib/features/project/screens/new_project_wizard_screen.dart`
- `test/widget/new_project_wizard_screen_test.dart`

No third implementation file and no additional child pass are authorized.
Future authority is conditional on independent acceptance and human push of
this exact five-file scope lock.

## Current behavior being temporarily replaced

The live Wizard has a working create flow. Its `wizard-create` CTA calls
`ProjectCreator.createProject`. A
`ProjectCreationSuccess` assigns the returned state to `projectStateProvider`
and navigates to `/project`; typed creation failures are presented to the user.
The focused Wizard widget suite covers the create CTA, destination
precondition, successful state/routing path, selected typed failures, and the
mobile picker gate.

The future pass intentionally replaces that working UI with a temporary,
non-creating Wizard foundation. `lib/app/router.dart` and both Home surfaces
remain unchanged. Reintroducing final creation integration, including a
functional final create CTA and service handoff, requires a later separate
human route decision and is not authorized or reserved here.

## Locked implementation behavior

The future pass may implement only:

- a six-step Wizard shell based on the exact inspect-only design handoff;
- Step 1 fields for `Projekti nimi`, `Seadme nimetus`,
  `Salvestuskoht`, and `Lisainfo`;
- widget-local draft state for all four values;
- parent-folder selection that stores only the returned path;
- `Edasi` enabled only when the project name is nonblank and a parent path is
  present;
- visible but non-functional Steps 2–6;
- forward/back navigation that preserves the draft; and
- dirty-draft cancel confirmation, while an untouched draft may return
  directly Home.

The implementation must preserve the existing BenchBeep identity and use only
existing theme, icon, and asset solutions. User-visible copy is Estonian and
state must not be communicated by color alone.

## Step 1 deliberate design exception

The zero-write boundary deliberately narrows the inspect-only design handoff:

- show no derived child-folder name preview;
- do not check or claim that the selected parent is writable;
- retain the selected parent path only in widget-local draft state;
- enable `Edasi` only when the project name is nonblank and a parent path has
  been selected;
- create no directory or file; and
- provide no collision or writability guarantee.

The selected parent path itself may be displayed as draft input. It must not be
presented as a validated final project path. This is an explicit design
exception required by the temporary foundation's `UI_LOCAL`/`ZERO_WRITE`
scope; canonical repo boundaries outrank the handoff.

## Zero-write boundary

The future pass must not:

- call `ProjectCreator.createProject`;
- assign a created project to application state or navigate to a created
  project;
- create or modify a directory, file, manifest, `events.jsonl`,
  `known_facts.json`, event, fact, projection, outline, marker, component, or
  Project ZIP artifact;
- derive or display a child-folder preview, check or claim writability, or
  promise collision-free or writable creation;
- define or change project-name persistence, project-directory naming,
  collision, overwrite, or final creation behavior;
- implement a final create CTA or functional Step 2–6 workflow; or
- add or change an asset, font, package, dependency, schema, writer,
  materializer, router, Home screen, or adjacent runtime file.

`lib/shared/services/project_creator.dart` and its persistence paths remain
inspect-only.

## Code-map and design-input boundary

This docs-only pass has `CODE_MAP_DISPOSITION: NOT_APPLICABLE`. The maintained
Wizard source and widget-test maps are read-only planning aids for the future
two-file slice; they grant no authority and are not updated here.

For `TRACEBENCH_NEW_PROJECT_WIZARD_FOUNDATION_PASS`, the human explicitly
authorizes one bounded combination of the responsibility zones named by those
two maps, only as needed to replace the current create form with the locked
UI-local foundation:

- source-map zones: creator provider and injection seams; form and transient
  state lifecycle; platform capability gate; directory selection; creation
  request and submission; success projection and routing; failure and
  capability feedback; rendering and interaction locking;
- test-map zones: platform seam; creator seam and request capture; picker seam;
  in-memory project fixture; isolated widget/router harness; destination
  precondition; success request and routing; failure presentation; mobile
  picker gate.

This explicit multi-zone decision is bounded to the two future allowlist files
and `UI_LOCAL`/`ZERO_WRITE` behavior. It authorizes no change to
`ProjectCreator`, persistence, writers, schemas, materializers, Home, router,
or any other file. The future implementation has:

```text
CODE_MAP_DISPOSITION: UPDATE_REQUIRED
```

After that implementation is accepted and committed, map maintenance must
occur against the accepted committed source in a separate docs-only lock/map
pass. This pass neither starts nor names that later pass.

The exact design input is:

`_incoming/ui_redesign/TraceBench_new_project_wizard/design_handoff_loo_projekt_nullist`

It is high-fidelity external visual/product input only, not route, runtime
truth, schema, acceptance evidence, or write authority. Its HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, SVG, PNG, fonts, and other bytes must not be copied, imported,
modified, staged, packaged, or referenced by runtime code. Canonical repo
owners and runtime contracts outrank it.

## Forbidden current surfaces

The current pass may not change Dart, Flutter, tests, code maps, schemas,
tools, assets, packages, writers, materializers, ZIP behavior, runtime files,
`_incoming`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/POHIKIRI.md`, task-specific specs, archive
evidence, or `.agents/skills/**`.

No board-outline, marker, component, canonical-event, creator-persistence,
AI/OCR/photo/template/phone, Board Canvas redesign, or later Wizard authority
is reserved.

## Verdict recording and exact staging

For this artifact-bearing pass, preserve:

```text
independent audit
-> record returned verdict in the designated block and ledger Status cell
-> prove the bounded recording freeze
-> exact human staging
```

Staging, commit, and push remain human-owned. Broad staging commands are
forbidden.

## Stops

Stop if any sixth current file or third implementation file is required; if
the two-file slice cannot remain `UI_LOCAL`/`ZERO_WRITE`; if the design
handoff is missing or ambiguous; if any `ProjectCreator`, filesystem,
application-project-state, persistence, event, projection, schema, writer,
materializer, asset, package, router, Home, code-map, or `_incoming` change is
needed; if project-name storage or directory naming must be decided; if
validation exposes a scope-relevant failure; or if any protected decision
cannot remain deferred.
