- Board Canvas UI auto-hide implementation is accepted/pushed as `dd69545` (`feat(board-canvas): add canvas focus mode`) after Claude Code implementation post-audit `ACCEPT_AS_IS` with `SAFE_FOR_COMMIT_PUSH: YES`.
- Project Overview / Workbench layout density is accepted/pushed/closed out as `19fc1c9` (`docs: close out project overview layout density`).
- Board Canvas layout-density polish is accepted/pushed and manual-smoke PASS with user wording: "kõik on passed. ja töötab". The accepted Board Canvas state includes read-only renderer shell, board-normalized placements, chip/selector flow, read-only inspector, measurement summary, visual-trace metadata, photo-alignment readiness metadata-only panel, pan/zoom/fit, component-level measurement badges/counts, selected inspector related-measurement count, UI-only tap-to-select, compact chrome, collapsed Placement and Safety / Evidence controls, canvas status overlay, volatile inspector hide/show, volatile focus mode, and persistent `renderer writes: none`.

## Current scope

This docs-only post-audit bookkeeping pass records accepted/pushed Board Canvas UI auto-hide implementation state. The accepted implementation adds deterministic, volatile, UI-only focus mode: `Focus canvas` hides the top control band and inspector/sidebar, `Show controls` restores them, and `renderer writes: none` remains visible.

The implementation remains private widget state only. It preserves Board Canvas behavior, canonical semantics, read-only renderer boundaries, and persistent `renderer writes: none`. No auto-hide persistence, cross-session memory, timers, event/fact writes, or writer/schema/materializer/validator/projection/Project ZIP changes were added. This route now points to `NEEDS_USER_DECISION`.

## Core boundaries

- `events.jsonl` is canonical truth; `known_facts.json` is projection/cache.
- AI/helper must not author canonical events or canonical facts.
- Photo pixels are not facts.
- `visual_trace` is not a net.
- Board Canvas remains read-only unless separately scoped.
- `renderer writes: none` must remain true.
- No V2 `sequence`.
- No writer/schema/materializer/validator/projection/Project ZIP/fact/event changes unless separately scoped.
- No facts/events/coordinates/net/path/trace/probe/pin/pad semantics change unless explicitly scoped.
