- Board Canvas top-chrome density scope lock is accepted/pushed as `d6797fd` (`docs: lock board canvas top-chrome density scope`).
- Board Canvas top-chrome density implementation is accepted/pushed as `462eab2` (`feat(board-canvas): compact top chrome density`) after Claude Code implementation post-audit `ACCEPT_AS_IS` with `SAFE_FOR_COMMIT_PUSH: YES`.
- Board Canvas top-chrome density route is closed out as `669d9f5` (`docs: close out board canvas top-chrome density`).
- Project Overview / Workbench layout density is accepted/pushed/closed out as `19fc1c9` (`docs: close out project overview layout density`).
- Board Canvas layout-density polish is accepted/pushed and manual-smoke PASS with user wording: "kõik on passed. ja töötab". The accepted Board Canvas state includes read-only renderer shell, board-normalized placements, chip/selector flow, read-only inspector, measurement summary, visual-trace metadata, photo-alignment readiness metadata-only panel, pan/zoom/fit, component-level measurement badges/counts, selected inspector related-measurement count, UI-only tap-to-select, compact chrome, collapsed Placement and Safety / Evidence controls, canvas status overlay, volatile inspector hide/show, and persistent `renderer writes: none`.

## Current scope

This docs-only pass scope-locks a future UI-only Board Canvas chrome auto-hide/collapse polish.

The next implementation target is `V2_BOARD_CANVAS_UI_AUTO_HIDE_IMPL_PASS`. That pass may make Board Canvas inspector/sidebar/top-control chrome more reversible and space-efficient so the canvas area feels more dominant, but only as volatile local UI state with explicit restore/show controls.

The future implementation must preserve Board Canvas behavior, canonical semantics, read-only renderer boundaries, and persistent `renderer writes: none`. Auto-hide must remain discoverable and recoverable, must not permanently hide safety/read-only meaning, and must not add persistence or cross-session memory.

## Core boundaries

- `events.jsonl` is canonical truth; `known_facts.json` is projection/cache.
- AI/helper must not author canonical events or canonical facts.
- Photo pixels are not facts.
- `visual_trace` is not a net.
- Board Canvas remains read-only unless separately scoped.
- `renderer writes: none` must remain true.
- No V2 `sequence`.
- No writer/schema/materializer/validator/projection/Project ZIP/fact/event changes unless separately scoped.
- No facts/events/coordinates/net/path/trace/probe/pin/pad semantics change unless explicitly scoped.
