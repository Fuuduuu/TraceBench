# Current State

Current pass: `TRACEBENCH_NEW_PROJECT_WIZARD_REDESIGN_SCOPE_LOCK_PASS`
Next recommended pass: `TRACEBENCH_NEW_PROJECT_WIZARD_FOUNDATION_PASS`

This Lane A docs sync records the human's 2026-07-27 choice of the BenchBeep
`Loo projekt nullist` redesign as the next priority and locks one narrow future
implementation pass. It changes no product behavior now.

## Authority basis

Baseline `b228a0b8dcfaf9b779b8c5ac5d14d7be2b001c5e`
(`docs: repair archive attestation and evidence ownership`) contains the
finished `TRACEBENCH_EVIDENCE_INTEGRITY_REPAIR_PASS`. Entry evidence showed
`HEAD == origin/main`, branch `main`, divergence `0 0`, and empty tracked and
cached diffs. The prior seven-file repair authority is spent.

The explicit human decision replaces the non-executable
`NEEDS_USER_DECISION` pointer with this five-file docs-only lock. No prior
allowlist is inherited and no separate closeout, release, or pointer-reset pass
is created.

## Locked implementation

`TRACEBENCH_NEW_PROJECT_WIZARD_FOUNDATION_PASS` may later change exactly:

- `lib/features/project/screens/new_project_wizard_screen.dart`
- `test/widget/new_project_wizard_screen_test.dart`

It is limited to a six-step Wizard shell, Step 1 project-data draft UI,
step navigation, and dirty-draft cancel confirmation. All values remain
widget-local. Steps 2–6 are visible but not implemented.

The live Wizard currently has a working `wizard-create` CTA:
`_createProject` calls `ProjectCreator.createProject`; success assigns
`projectStateProvider` and navigates to `/project`; typed creation failures are
shown to the user; and focused widget tests cover that create flow. The future
pass intentionally replaces this working UI with a temporary non-creating
foundation. It must not call the creator or create a directory, file, manifest,
event, projection, fact, or other persistent state. Home and router stay
unchanged. Final creation integration requires a later separate route decision
and is not authorized here.

Step 1 deliberately deviates from the design handoff: it shows no derived
child-folder preview, performs and claims no writability check, retains only
the selected parent path as widget-local draft state, gates `Edasi` solely on
a nonblank project name plus a selected parent path, creates no directory or
file, and gives no collision or writability guarantee.

The human explicitly authorizes the future two-file pass to combine the
affected responsibility zones named by the maintained Wizard source and test
maps only for this `UI_LOCAL`/`ZERO_WRITE` foundation. It authorizes no
`ProjectCreator`, persistence, writer, schema, materializer, Home, or router
change. Its `CODE_MAP_DISPOSITION: UPDATE_REQUIRED`; after accepted committed
implementation, map maintenance belongs to a separate unnamed and unarmed
docs-only lock/map pass.

## Source and boundary

The exact design handoff under
`_incoming/ui_redesign/TraceBench_new_project_wizard/design_handoff_loo_projekt_nullist`
is high-fidelity visual/product input only. It is inspect-only and must not be
copied, imported, modified, staged, or runtime-referenced. Existing theme,
icons, assets, source, tests, and canonical owners outrank it.

No board-outline, marker, component, canonical event, creator persistence,
schema, writer, materializer, package, asset, Project ZIP, AI/OCR/photo/
template/phone, or Board Canvas redesign authority is created.
