- `TRACEBENCH_WORKBENCH_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM_REFRESH_PASS` → `94a1143` (`docs: refresh workbench architecture reference`)

## Accepted runtime baseline

- Workbench remains a 3-zone UI:
  - Left rail
  - Dominant read-only Board Canvas center
  - Right contextual panel
- Left rail is panel-mode: `Inspector`, `Placements`, `Safety`, with `Trace` and `Repair map` visible but disabled/inert.
- Focus action remains a canvas-corner action (`Focus canvas` / control recovery path) with fit/recenter/zoom as canvas-side controls.
- `Placements` and `Safety` switch read-only contextual panel modes.
- Component selection updates the Inspector/read-only panel mode.
- Empty-canvas tap may only clear local UI selection/panel state.
- Board Canvas renderer is read-only, with `renderer writes: none`.
- `Known-facts`/legacy visual evidence and metadata remain read-only as currently scoped.
- Optional measurement value overlay badges are available on Board Canvas:
  - existing projected `MeasurementFact` value + unit only;
  - existing explicit component association only;
  - existing `board_normalized` component visual anchors only;
  - selected-component visibility toggle and global Show All / Hide All;
  - deterministic stacked badges for multiple measurements;
  - stale/suspect/invalid readings marked as non-authoritative UI metadata;
  - volatile UI-only state with no persistence or canonical visibility events.

## Not accepted in this route

- No inline value/unit/Save write-flow is accepted in this route.
- No writer/materializer/validator, schema, tools, sample, generated, platform, dependency, Project ZIP, app routing, or `_incoming` behavior changes.
- Runtime/test changes for the overlay implementation are accepted/pushed at `e1f78ed`; this closeout pass is docs-only.
- No event authoring, no projection persistence, no overlay persistence, and no Add Component work.
- `renderer writes: none` remains.
- Measure Sheet remains unchanged as existing recording/write fallback.
- Scope-lock pass is accepted as `8544a4b` (`docs: lock workbench measurement overlay scope`) with independent post-audit closeout pushed at `f1226d4`; no runtime or protected-surface edits were made in the post-audit bookkeeping.

## Current scope

- This pass is docs-only post-audit closeout for the accepted/pushed read-only measurement overlay implementation.
- Allowed route docs are defined in `docs/ACTIVE_SCOPE_LOCK.md`.
- Measure Sheet and Add Component are explicitly deferred and preserved unchanged.

## Validation baseline

- `git diff --check`
- `py -3 tools/validate_all.py`

## Workbench measurement overlay manual smoke record

- Pass: `V2_WORKBENCH_MEASUREMENT_OVERLAY_MANUAL_SMOKE_PASS`
- Manual smoke result: `PASS_WITH_NIT`.
- Accepted implementation remains `e1f78ed` (`feat(board-canvas): add read-only measurement value overlay`).
- Previous implementation post-audit closeout is accepted/pushed as `300d2c2` (`docs: record workbench measurement overlay impl post-audit`).
- Evidence recorded from user screenshots/visual check: Board Canvas opens; measurement overlay control is visible; global Show All / Hide All works visually; a measurement badge appears near the component; the badge displays one value + unit (`0.1 ohm`); the selected component inspector opens/updates; `renderer writes: none` remains visible; Measure Sheet remains available; Board Canvas overlay flow does not activate Add Component; Add Component remains deferred for Board Canvas / overlay work.
- Nit: Project Overview still shows an existing Add Component action. This is non-blocking because this overlay pass did not implement or activate Add Component inside Board Canvas / Workbench overlay flow. Add Component remains a separate protected future track.
- Route after this manual smoke record: `NEEDS_USER_DECISION`.
