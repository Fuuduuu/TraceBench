# Current State

## Current pass

`V2_WORKBENCH_MEASUREMENT_OVERLAY_SCOPE_LOCK_POST_AUDIT_PASS`

## Next recommended pass

`V2_WORKBENCH_MEASUREMENT_OVERLAY_IMPL_PASS`

## Repository handoff

- Repository: `C:\Users\Kasutaja\Desktop\TraceBench`
- Branch: `main`
- Latest accepted docs-hygiene baseline pass: `TRACEBENCH_WORKBENCH_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM_REFRESH_PASS` at `94a1143` (`docs: refresh workbench architecture reference`).
- Current pass purpose: lock the projection-only Workbench measurement overlay direction with read-only runtime assumptions and explicit route/provenance alignment.

## Accepted docs-hygiene baseline

The current docs-hygiene sequence is accepted through:

- `TRACEBENCH_DOCS_HYGIENE_SCOPE_LOCK_PASS` → `dbe9271` (`docs: lock tracebench docs hygiene scope`)
- `TRACEBENCH_AUDIT_INDEX_NORMALIZATION_PASS` → `7c12aa7` (`docs: normalize audit index route bookkeeping`)
- `TRACEBENCH_PASS_QUEUE_ARCHIVE_PASS` → `c70e23f` (`docs: archive completed pass-queue history`)
- `TRACEBENCH_CORE_INVARIANTS_OWNER_REFRESH_PASS` → `b60ae0c` (`docs: centralize core invariants owner in TRUTH_INDEX`)
- `TRACEBENCH_MODEL_ROUTING_OWNER_REFRESH_PASS` → `a56721d` (`docs: centralize model-routing owner in MODEL_ROUTING`)
- `CURRENT_STATE_HISTORY_TRIM_PASS` → `4af4ac6` (`docs: trim current-state into operational handoff`)
- `TRACEBENCH_WORKBENCH_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM_REFRESH_PASS` → `94a1143` (`docs: refresh workbench architecture reference`)

## Accepted runtime baseline

- Workbench remains a 3-zone UI:
  - Left rail
  - Dominant read-only Board Canvas center
  - Right contextual panel
- Left rail is panel-mode: `Inspector`, `Placements`, `Safety`, with `Trace` and `Repair map` visible but disabled/inert.
- Focus action remains a canvas-corner action (`Focus canvas` / control recovery path) with fit/recenter/zoom as canvas-side controls.
- `Placements` and `Safety` switch read-only contextual panel modes.
- Component selection updates the Inspector/read-only panel mode.
- Empty-canvas tap may only clear local UI selection/panel state.
- Board Canvas renderer is read-only, with `renderer writes: none`.
- `Known-facts`/legacy visual evidence and metadata remain read-only as currently scoped.

## Not accepted in this route

- No inline value/unit/Save write-flow is accepted in this route.
- No runtime/model/runtime, writer/materializer/validator, schema, tests, tools, sample, generated, platform, or `_incoming` behavior changes.
- No event authoring, no projection persistence, no overlay persistence, and no Add Component work.
- `renderer writes: none` remains.
- Measure Sheet remains unchanged as existing recording/write fallback.
- Scope-lock pass is accepted as `8544a4b` (`docs: lock workbench measurement overlay scope`) with independent post-audit `ACCEPT_AS_IS`; no runtime or protected-surface edits were required in this post-audit bookkeeping.

## Current scope

- This pass is docs-only post-audit documentation and routing update.
- Allowed route docs are defined in `docs/ACTIVE_SCOPE_LOCK.md`.
- Measure Sheet and Add Component are explicitly deferred and preserved unchanged.
